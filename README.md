# Password Validator Kata

This is my first attempt to solve the Password Validator kata using Clojure

# Goal
We want to ensure that our users' passwords have the following rules:

	 - Have more than 8 characters
	 - Contains a capital letter
	 - Contains a lowercase
	 - Contains a number
	 - Contains an underscore

# Key
This kata shows the importance of:

  * Selecting good examples

  * Selecting the test order
	
  * Having good assertions (testing only one thing and being always true)
